Visualizing Signal Power Density

3 parts:

-spectrum			-> something like the crosstalk/coexistence
-spectrogram			-> when the spectrum is changing in time (like some kind of modulation?)(or the interference of 2 signals)
-power density map

-obstacles
-directional antenna
-video of signal propagation
-sikeres és sikertelen vétel (vizuálisan)
-zavaró jel

-dragging probes
-and probes themselves

-sima wifi signal 2 channelel
-nem kell chirp -> az külön



what do we want to demonstrate:

generally about the three visualizations -> the axes
dimensional is needed
this is good for troubleshooting and verifying the model during development

-spectrum figures
	what does it do
	the signal and the noise is displayed separately
	the scale is automatic, based on all signals. and all figures have the same scale, so the signals can be compared
	the obstacles attenuate the signal, and there is path loss as well
	important parameters: spectrumMode, spectrumFigureInterpolationSize
	the common parts -> the shared parameters and what they are about
	some description in the existing radio medium activity showcase ?
	what should the scenario be ?
		wifi signals, 2 channels
		probe
		directional antenna ? ? ? ? where and when ?

at first, just 4 nodes as in the crosstalk and coexistence...maybe some wall somewhere
then, the same, just with spectrograms
then, the four nodes in the building, with directional antennas ? ? ? ? -> the directional antenna is important because why ?
or just one pair should have the directional antennas (the ones between which the wall is)

3 videos check -> dont necessarily use this in the showcase -> it needs to be user recreatable (this would be too slow)
screenshots to omnetpp/inet website

the spectogram is frequency and power over time

the spectrum figure is power over frequency (changing over time)

the power density map is power in space in a fixed frequency (changing over time)

the local power density map should be not at all nodes just one pair maybe ?

nope this just not cool.

-demonstrate the colors...transmitted signal, noise, signal (between the transmitter and the recipient node; between the transmitter and another node)
-demonstrate the frequency dependency -> between one of each channel's node

-> so maybe one of the nodes should not display the local power density map -> it seems that the local map has more resolution
